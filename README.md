# Almost Real Resume (GPT-3)

This uses GPT-3 API access to generate fake resumes.

In short, when using GPT-3, you pass it in a question or statement (with some parameters) and it spits back with some cool stuff.

This project was an attempt to improve the previous fake resume generator -> https://github.com/jsonresume/jsonresume-fake (It was built with PyTorch and intended as a tutorial for anyone wanting to try ML)

## Getting Started

```
pip3 -r requirements.txt install
npm i
```

## The Question

All of the generated output that you can in `./gpt3-output` was generated by one question to GPT-3.
